**Total:** ~10-15 seconds

## 🔗 Monitor Deployment:

**Watch in real-time:**
- [Netlify Deploys Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zacharyvorsteg/deploys)

**Check your live site:**
- [zacharyvorsteg.com](https://zacharyvorsteg.com)

---

## ✅ If Deploy Succeeds:

1. Visit zacharyvorsteg.com
2. See your new site
3. Test contact form
4. Share with your network!

---

## 🆘 If Still Fails:

Look for these in the deploy log:

**If you see "Next.js" anywhere:**
- You need to also go to "Build plugins" in Netlify
- Remove @netlify/plugin-nextjs from there too

**If you see "npm" anywhere:**
- Build command wasn't fully cleared
- Go back to Build settings and ensure it's completely blank

---

**🎯 I've opened your Netlify deploys page - watch it build!**

Should complete in ~10-15 seconds.
